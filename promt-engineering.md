Swapping out the stock 107 cubic inch engine for a 114 cubic inch engine on a 2020 Road King is a significant modification and requires careful planning, expertise, and potentially specialized tools. It's essential to consider factors such as compatibility, warranty implications, and legalities before undertaking such a project. Here's a general guide to give you an idea of the process involved:

## Research and Planning:

Understand the differences between the 107 and 114 engines, including compatibility with your bike's frame, transmission, and other components.
Check if the 114 engine you plan to use is compatible with your bike's year and model. It's essential to ensure that the engine mounts, electronics, and other components align correctly.
Research any additional modifications or upgrades necessary to support the 114 engine, such as fuel delivery system adjustments, exhaust modifications, and cooling upgrades.

## Acquire Necessary Parts:

Obtain the 114 cubic inch engine along with any required peripherals such as wiring harnesses, sensors, and mounting hardware.
Depending on the specifics of your bike and the donor engine, you may need additional parts such as a new exhaust system, air cleaner assembly, and engine management components.
Gather Tools and Equipment:

Ensure you have access to a comprehensive set of tools, including wrenches, sockets, torque wrenches, and specialty tools specific to Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
You may need a motorcycle lift or stand to elevate the bike during the engine swap process, providing better access to components.

## Preparation:

Disconnect the battery to prevent electrical mishaps during the swap.
Drain the fluids from the existing engine, including oil and coolant, and properly dispose of them.
Remove any components obstructing access to the engine, such as the fuel tank, exhaust system, and primary drive cover.

## Engine Removal:

Disconnect all electrical connections, hoses, and cables connected to the engine.
Support the bike securely on a lift or stand and remove the mounting bolts securing the engine to the frame.
Carefully lift the old engine out of the frame and set it aside.

## Engine Installation:

Place the 114 cubic inch engine into the frame, ensuring proper alignment with the mounting points.
Reconnect all electrical connections, hoses, and cables, following the manufacturer's guidelines and wiring diagrams.
Install any additional components or peripherals required for the 114 engine, such as the exhaust system and air cleaner assembly.

## Final Checks and Testing:

Double-check all connections, fasteners, and fluid levels before starting the engine.
Reconnect the battery and start the engine to verify proper operation.
Monitor for any leaks, abnormal sounds, or warning lights indicating potential issues.
Take the bike for a short test ride to evaluate performance and ensure everything is functioning as expected.

## Legal and Warranty Considerations:

Be aware of any warranty implications resulting from engine modifications and consult with your Harley-Davidson dealership or a qualified mechanic.
Ensure compliance with local regulations regarding vehicle modifications, emissions standards, and roadworthiness.

## Maintenance and Upkeep:

Regularly inspect and maintain the bike, paying particular attention to the newly installed engine and associated components.
Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for service intervals and fluid changes to keep the engine running smoothly.
It's crucial to approach an engine swap with caution and attention to detail, as even minor errors could lead to significant problems down the line. If you're not comfortable performing the swap yourself, consider hiring a professional motorcycle mechanic with experience working on Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
