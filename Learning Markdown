# ***Learning Markdown***

In this article, you will learn the basics of markdown from different symbols you can use to change style of text, how to make
a link in your page as well as explaining what markdown is in general and why we use it! As you follow along with the article
we will explore this knowledge. And at the end of the article, I will present some drop down questions to quiz yourself! Think of 
these as flashcards!


### *What is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a lightweight computer language that you use to format elements such as link, font styles, pictures and anything else you can
add to a word document. My best example would be, imagine if you saw behind the scenes of a normal word document. All the font changes and styles and 
any other formatting change is done instantly while using Markdown, you are in control of indicating what everything will look like. 

### *Why do we use Markdown?

**Why?** That is a fantastic question! Markdown is very versitle! it can be used to create books, emails, presentations, websites and many more options!
Some more reasons as to why we use Markdown is that Markdown is independant, which means it you can create on any operating systems. 
Markdown is everywhere! Which means a lot of big sites you use on a daily basis support Markdown. The most important reason why to my mind is the fact that
even if the application you use stops working for some reason, your Markdown format text is still readable in any text editing application.

### *What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?

The Symbol is #. If you wish to do the largest heading for the most pop! it will be the same symbol # used one time! Ex. # Heading info
If you wish to do the smallest heading for a little eye grabber, it will be the same symbol we discussed, # but used 6 times! Ex. ###### Heading info
_Enusre you put a space between the number signs and the heading name_

### When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?

So we want some emphasis?! Perfect choice! The main two are styles are **Bold** and _Italic_.
For Markdown, the way we would do a Bold font is by using ** in front and the end of the Bold words. Ex. ** Bold Text ** with no spaces between ** and the letters.
For Italic, it will be * in front of and the end of the words. Ex * italic word * with no spaces between * and the letters.
If you want the most emphasis on your font, you can have bold and itlaic combinded to look like this ***Extremely important***. 
The way you would go about this is *** in front and the end of the words. Ex. *** Text here *** with no space between * and letters.

### How do you create a link with Markdown?

You can create a link by first putting link desciption text in Brackets [ ]. The next step will be to wrap the URL in parentheses ( ). Example below!
[ link info ] ( wwww.12345.com ). No spaces between the symbols and the lettering to complete the link.

### What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?

You can make a an unordered list very easily! This will help to clean up your text and page! To start the list, the line must be preceding by -,* or +. Ex.
- List option 1
* List option 2
+ List option 3
