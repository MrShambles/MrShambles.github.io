## **Growth Mindset**
When I first started riding bikes, I was _nervous_ and _scared_. However, the Growth mindset is exactly how I was able to over come my fears.
Never stop learning and getting better in all aspects. Always hunting for more information and searching for more challenges no matter what obstacles you face.
Always keep a positive attitude even when faced a new obstract challenege or a even a simple task. We learn from mistakes and we are able to turn those mistakes into success.
## **Inspiration and Daily Reminder**
My inspiration and whats really going to keep me motivated is a very personal reason but one the best. When I seperated from the military, I had a hard time converting 
back into the civilian world. Whether it was making new friends, finding a fullfilling job, finding motivation. I heavily relied on video games to get me through some hard times.
My dream is to become a game developer, and the thought of a game I help create that could help a veteran or anyone find an escape and have something happy in their lives has been
the driving force to get into this field and make an impact.

|  Mirror Talk Topics  |
|----------------------|
| 1. Help a Veteran    |
| 2. Better Life       |
| 3. Family            |

These are more then just reminders, these are conversations I _will_ have with myself if I ever doubt my ability to learn and succeed in any new tasks I take.

My name is Michael Roark, I am a 29 year old veteran, and this is where the story begins. Thank you for reading.
