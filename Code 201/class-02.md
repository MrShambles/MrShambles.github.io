# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

<details>
<summary>Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?</summary>


## Using semantic elements in HTML is important for several reasons:

### Accessibility
 Semantic HTML helps screen readers and other assistive technologies better understand the content and structure of a webpage. This improves accessibility for users with disabilities, making the content more understandable and navigable.

### SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
 Search engines use semantic HTML to understand the content and context of a webpage, which can improve the page's ranking in search results. Using semantic elements correctly can help search engines index and prioritize content more accurately.

### Readability and Maintainability Semantic HTML makes the code easier to read and understand for developers, which in turn makes it easier to maintain and update. By using elements like < header >, < footer >, < nav >, and < article >, the structure of the document becomes more self-explanatory.

### Consistency and Structure
Semantic elements provide a standardized way to structure web content. This promotes consistency across websites and makes it easier for developers to collaborate and understand each other's code.

### Future-proofing
Semantic HTML ensures that your website remains compatible with future technologies and standards. By following best practices and using semantic elements, you reduce the risk of your website becoming outdated or incompatible with new technologies.

<summary>What is the use of an else if?</summary>

The else if statement is used in JavaScript to specify a new condition to test if the preceding if condition evaluates to false. It allows for multiple conditional branches in a decision-making process. If the initial if condition is false, the else if condition(s) are evaluated sequentially until one evaluates to true, and then the corresponding code block executes. This allows for more complex logic and handling of various scenarios within a program.
